### Hi
I'm Trevor, and this is my GitHub profile.

-----

🌐 I'm passionate about web development. While I tend to lean towards frontend, I'm experienced with backend too.

🐧 I'm a big fan of Linux and open source. I currently run a mix of Fedora [Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/) and [CoreOS](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/) across all of my devices.

🎓 I recently graduated from NC State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.

🤖 I currently mentor [DARC SIDE](https://6502.team), my former high-school robotics team.

💼 I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-nelson-a730411a0/).

### Currently Working On:
- [armchair](https://github.com/trevnels/armchair), a full-stack web application that will provide statistics and predictions for teams at FIRST Robotics Competition events. It's the spiritual successor of [one of my earlier projects from high school](https://trevnels.github.io/projects/ossus/), but at a much larger scale and without the tedious manual data collection.
- [adwaitium](https://github.com/trevnels/adwaitium), my opinionated [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) image which makes some tweaks on top of the base Silverblue/UBlue experience, such as consistent theming between GTK3, GTK4, and Qt out of the box.

For more information about me and details on my projects, check out my [personal website](https://trevnels.github.io/). At some point I may add a blog there too.
